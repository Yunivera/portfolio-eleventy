------------ Someday --------------------
* Header link should slide from the side like Jira does:
  * See this example: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16989585/css-3-slide-in-from-left-transition
* Add content to workshops page
* If needed - add accordion support to Markdown with https://github.com/bioruebe/markdown-it-collapsible
* Speed up build process on localhost (if 5 seconds of wait is too much):
  * Disable caching of css/js if on localhost
* Add map of countries I've visited:
  * https://www.amcharts.com/visited_countries/#AT,BE,HR,CZ
* Rethink block quotes? (they look ok for now)
* Check different color palette (leave it as it is for now)
  * https://coolors.co/palette/000000-14213d-fca311-e5e5e5-ffffff
* Make logo/favicon with some AI generator
* Add ToC to posts
* Add criticalCSS (this needs to be benchmarked if it really helps, for now I have 4x100 lightbox score)
