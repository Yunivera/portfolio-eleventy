If your Node.js project with a Gulp workflow fails when running for the master branch, follow these steps to identify and fix the issue:

1. Check the Error Message

Look for error logs in the terminal output. Key details include:

Syntax errors

Missing dependencies

File path issues

Permission problems



2. Common Issues and Fixes

Missing Dependencies: Ensure all dependencies are installed by running:

npm install

Version Mismatch: Check the Node.js and Gulp versions:

node -v
gulp -v

If mismatched, update to the required versions:

npm install gulp@<required-version> --save-dev

Gulpfile Issues: Verify your gulpfile.js or gulpfile.mjs for syntax errors or missing plugins.

Environment Variables: Ensure all required environment variables are set for the workflow.

Branch-Specific Configurations: If your workflow behaves differently for the master branch, verify branch-specific configurations in your CI/CD pipeline or scripts.


3. Run Gulp Locally

Test the workflow locally:

gulp

If it fails locally, troubleshoot the gulp tasks and their dependencies.


4. Clear Node Modules and Cache

Sometimes clearing the cache or reinstalling dependencies resolves issues:

rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install


5. Debugging in CI/CD

If the failure occurs in a CI/CD environment (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins), review the logs.

Ensure the CI/CD runner uses the correct Node.js and Gulp versions.


6. Run Tests

If you have tests, run them to identify issues:

npm test


7. Update Packages

Outdated or incompatible packages may cause issues. Update them:

npm outdated
npm update


8. Reproduce the Error

Check out the master branch locally and try reproducing the error:

git checkout master
gulp
