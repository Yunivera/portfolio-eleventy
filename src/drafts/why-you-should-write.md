If you ask any writer if they recommend writing, I'm pretty sure they will tell you: "Yes!"

Writing is a great way to learn. In two different ways:

First, if you write on a technical topic, you will need to do some research. Unless you are a specialist, you better make sure that you researched all the pros and cons of what you are talking about. If not ...

You will learn that are you wrong. From strangers in the Internet. Commenting on your articles. Seriously, try posting that is incorrect on reddit or hackernews and someone will almost certainly point out the shortcomings of your article.

This can be discouraging. There is nothing worse than getting a negative feedback on something that you think you spent a lot of time researching, editing 10 times, etc. 

Some people might simply misunderstood you. And some will be just trolls, downvoting you articles or posting stupid comments. There is not much you can do about this. Some people deal with that by not reading comments. I've decided to not include a comments section on my blog for that reason - I prefer to spend my time writing useful articles instead of arguing with strangers on the internet. But if someone really wants to give me feedback, I have a contact form (and I'm also cross-posting on various other websites like Medium, dev.to, reddit or hackernews). So far, this setup works fine for me. I probably have much less interaction with my readers, but I can live with that. I'm not an influencer who needs to get enough "likes and comments" to earn money. I still sometimes get emails from readers when they have a question or a comment.
