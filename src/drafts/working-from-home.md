If you ask 2 people what they think about working from home, one will tell you that it means freedom, improved productivity, and hundreds of hours saved on commuting. The other - that it means slowly loosing you sanity, having hard time to motivate yourself to work, and missing most of the team interactions.

Well, it's a bit of both. Maybe without the insanity part (at least that's what the voices in my head made me write ;). But for me, working from home is a good experience, so let me share some advice how you can make it more enjoyable. Especially now, that due to the quarantine, many companies had to switch to "work from home" mode within days.

Working from home is not for everyone. The more experienced you are, the easier it's going to be for you. As a junior developer, you will learn a ton from your senior colleagues while working in the office. It's not impossible to be a remote junior developer (and I sure there are plenty of people who succeeded), but if you have a choice, I strongly recommend to start by working in an office.

I keep saying "working from home" instead of "working remotely". Some people don't like to stay at home the whole day. They go to a coworking space or a coffee shop to do some work there. Changing scenery can help you boost your creativity. Often it will be you only chance to go outside during the day and if you live alone, it will be your only opportunity to can speak with other people. If you are getting crazy at home, try to work from somewhere else from time to time. You will be less productive (due to the noise, interruptions, or lack of a few external screens that you have at home), but you might be much more happy.

* Exercises
Some people do them in the morning (I tried and I hated it that way), some people do them in the evening (but the gyms are usually crowded with people who work 9 to 5). I like to hit the gym in the middle of the day, usually around 1PM (right before the lunch).
One of the benefits is the energy boost after the gym.
But also, I've noticed that if I don't work out, after a few days I have much more back pain from sitting in from of the computer.

* Equipment
You are spending 8 hours in your home office, so invest in good tools if you can:
* Good chair is a must. I'm using the Marcus chair from IKEA since a couple of years and while it's very basic (it offers no adjustment of lumbar support or arms rests), I'm happy with it.
* Adjustable desk. They can be quite expensive, especially in countries where standing desks are not very popular so you have a selection of 1 or 2 overpriced brands. But they are totally worth the money if you ask me (I bought the adjustable frame and ordered a custom cut "desk" - the wooden top part separately and that saved me around 40% of the price comparing with a read-made adjustable desk). Not only they can help you with back pain (make sure to check what's the proper height of the desk!) but they will also help you focus. When I'm tired and I don't want to drink yet another coffee, I just stand up. If you like standing a lot, but your legs hurt, get a standing mat (they cost around $40 on Amazon).
* Microphone. If you are doing daily calls with the team, get a good microphone. Otherwise, it's a nightmare to talk with you and people will hate you. I'm using Bose QC35 headphones with a built-in microphone that is good enough. Additional benefit of a bluetooth headset is that I can pick up calls and still type on the keyboard
* Good internet connection. If you can, upgrade your internet connection. It will not only affect the waiting time for your docker images, but it will affect the quality of video calls with you.
* Other stuff that I'm using: Kinesis Advantage 2 keyboard, Magic Trackpad (I had to buy a mouse anyway and I liked the gestures that Macbook supports), DELL UW34... screen

<!-- * Make yourself available -->
* Set expectations

Companies that are not used to remote work are afraid that their employees will slack off. And, of course, some of them will. It's hard to concentrate after lunch when the comfortable bed is just 2 meters away. From my experience, working 9 to 5 at home doesn't work. I start working around 8 AM and I take some time in the middle of the day to run some chores, visit the gym, and eat lunch. Sometimes, when I'm tired, I take a nap. When I get back to work, I usually stay until 7 or 8 PM (depends on my plans for the evening). All my clients know that I will be available in the morning and in the afternoon. And that makes everyone happy.

Make sure you set your expectations correctly and make yourself available when needed. If you are having a bad day, take half a day off. If you need to take your kid to the doctor, do this. Just make sure you inform your managed about that. People understand that emergencies happen and, unless you have a terrible manager, they will be supportive. But don't try to "sneak out" of work. It might work a few times, but when you will be caught, you will loose a lot of credibility and it will be hard to make up for it. Don't be late for the daily standups if you team have them. Make a list of tasks that you do during the day, so you can report what you did yesterday. You will be surprised how easily it can be to forget a lot of small but important details of yesterday's work. 

Compare those 2 reports:
"Yesterday I worked on a contact form"
versus
"Yesterday I've added a client side validation to our contact form. This required installing a foo library - Tom, we will need to add it to the CI pipeline, so let's discuss it later. I've run into a bug where our form was not displayed for unauthenticated users. It took me a bit of time to figure out what's going on, but it's fixed now."

Diligent reporting builds trust with your managers and trust is one of the most important parts of working from home. But don't overdo your reports either, try to keep them detailed enough that everyone involved in the meeting get enough information of what happened and if something requires more input from another person, take if offline.

Which brings me to the next point:

* Learn to communicate efficiently

I'm writing very verbose emails. I often catch myself pouring paragraphs and paragraphs of text just to explain something. Please, don't be me! It's hard to learn how to write emails with just enough details to make everything clear. I'm often editing my emails before sending them. I proofread them a few times, always looking at what can be removed.

Quite often, a screenshot of a short GIF are much better than a full page of bug description. I'm using Skitch for screenshots (it has some nice tools for annotating images with big arrows and text) and LICECap for recording GIFs of my screen. For every new feature in GitHub or GitLab I try to include an image/video of how it looks like - otherwise the reviewer would have to set up everything on their own computer only to have a quick glance of the new feature (and almost no one has time for that).
