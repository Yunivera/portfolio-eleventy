Here are the slides for my talk called "[It's 2019 and I'm still using Python 2. Should I be worried?](https://youtu.be/8a_TEjCl8NQ?t=429)".

Since I update the slides before each conference to incorporate any new ideas that come to my mind and make sure they are up to date, if you are interested in a particular version of the slides, just send me an email and I will sent them your way.

Enjoy!
