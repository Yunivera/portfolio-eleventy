I like to listen (or read) about other programmers' tools. It can be stories about how they are using Vim, VS Code or whatever other editor they prefer, read their dotfiles looking for something that I could use for myself or it can me reviews of the hardware tools and why they like them.

Today, I would like to share my adventure with a quite unusual keyboard - Kinesis Advantage 2.

I first saw the Kinesis keyboard in action in 2013 when I first arrived at new job. One of the senior developers, who explained to us what we will be working on, was using one. He was a heavy Emacs user and a sight of him fluently using the computer with only this "broken-in-half" keyboard (mouse was used only in the browser) was something that I will remember for a long time. It made me think - "they don't fuck around here!".

I didn't think much about Kinesis, until there was a bit of hype about mechanical keyboards in my team a few years later. Many of my friends were switching from the ugly, default keyboards that we were given to different brands of mechanical keyboards and I have to say, I like how some of them looked and felt. Many of the keyboards were being funded on Kickstarter or some other crowdfunding website: [Ergodox EX](https://ergodox-ez.com/), [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/) or [Keyboardio](https://shop.keyboard.io/). But I didn't like the idea of spending a few hundreds $ on something that I can't test before buying. Also, I didn't really trust the dates from Kickstarted campaign - mass producing a hardware product in China is not easy and there will be slips (checking some of them, I wasn't wrong, the Keyboardio that was funded in July 2015 mentions on their [update page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keyboardio/the-model-01-an-heirloom-grade-keyboard-for-seriou/updates) in April 2018 that *the Kickstarted units have almost shipped*). 2 of my colleagues had the Kinesis keyboard, and one of them actually had the previous Kinesis model at home and was willing to lend it to me, so I could give it a try. *Why not* - I said. And that how the most awful week of my life started.

The first steps with a new keyboard were terrible. I was typing probably around 5 words per minute. After the first morning, I gave up and switched back to the old keyboard. But I kept the Kinesis and every day after work I was doing some touch typing lessons to get used to it. At the end of the week, I was tried to use it for the whole day and it wasn't so bad (I was still typing much much slower than on the old keyboard). But I saw the potential in Kinesis. So in October 2016 I bought my own.

2 years later, I can't imagine myself using a different keyboard for work. Here are a few reasons why I love it:

## I finally learned how to touch type

## It has a great technical support

## Programmable macros stored in text files


Kinesis keyboard is incredibly expensive ($349) when compared to the most popular keyboards on Amazon ($10-$70). But, it's a tool that I'm using on average 6 hours per working day. And as with other tools, I've decided to spend a bit more money up front and enjoy the pleasure of using a good quality tool, instead of fighting with a bad one.
Using a Kinesis keyboard didn't affect how I'm using other keyboards - on a Macbook keyboard, I'm still semi-touch-typing with 4 fingers. So don't worry that if you start using a Kinesis keyboard, you won't be able to use a *normal* keyboard.
