## What I learned from my first recorded screencast


Last two weeks were very busy. I've spend a riddiculous number of hours recording my PyCon 2020 tutorial. It's funny to look back and see how "I'm sure I can record it over a weekend" turned into over 60 hours or recording and editing. But I wanted my video to be as good as possible, hoping that it will help a lot of Python programmers. In the end, I'm happy with the final result and I think I learned something, so if you are thinking about recording a screencast, maybe you can learn on my mistakes ;)

### Equipment

I bought the microphone, hoping that it will help get rid of my keyboard noises. No chance.

Webcamera in my Macbook is terrible. I tried to buy a better one, but since the coronavirus outbreak (if you are reading it in the future, this is the first year of the quarantine ;), apparently everyone needed a web cam and all good ones are gone.

## Software 

I decided to use screenflow. I did a bit of a research and many people recommended it, so even thought it's expensive (129$ for a license) I decided to go for it. My main reason was that I didn't want to learn another tool and screenflow had an opinion of being an easy to use, yet sufficient for anything that you might need when screencasting. And I have to admit - I was not disappointed. Whenever I was wondering how to do something, a quick search was pointing me to screenflow's forum where I found the answers. The interface is easy to use.

## So what did I actually learned?

* Learn your shortcuts. If you see that you are doing something over and over again, there is probably a shortcut for this. After 1 hour of cutting videos in part, removing the unnecessary part and dragging the remaining part I actually learned that I can use shortcuts to mark the beginning and the end of a cut and remove it, merging the rest of the video together. Everything without even touching the mouse.

* When you sit down to recording after a break - test your microphone. Once I forgot to turn it on and the other time, a different input device was selected. And as much as watching myself playing a "mime" was fun, I had to rerecord those parts.

* Mac is not 16:9! I didn't notice it and my video will have ugly black stripes on the sides :( But I was that there is some software to enforce a different aspect ration and next time I will use it.

* If Screenflow is crashing for you - disable the wave and thumbnails. During the final edits, when I was modifying all the short clips together, Screenflow was crashing every few minutes. Luckily, it was usually saving the progress, but nevertheless, it was annoying. I don't blame it - I had 2,5 hours of content split into literally thousands of short video/audio clips. But I found out that hiding the waveform and thumbnails stopped the crashes completely.

* When you record and you make a mistake, don't stop the video. Just start the sentence again. It took a few hours to realize that it's much faster to cut bloopers from a long video than to stop the video, click "Discard" and start over.

* On the other hand - that's something that I realized after processing - try to "restart" on a whole sentence, not in the middle. If you try to combine a sentence with 3 different video clips, it will be hard to make it sound natural.

* You don't have to "synchronize" what you say with what you do on the screen. If you write some code but you realize you said something wrong, it's fine, just say the correct thing and move audio over the part where you write the code. 

All in all, it was an interesting experience. I will need a longer break before I decide to do this again, but hopefully, my creation will help many other programmers in their journey with Python.
