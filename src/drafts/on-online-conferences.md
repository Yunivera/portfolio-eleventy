2021 was a second year of online conferences probably for most of us. But unlike in 2020 when most of them were not planned as online and had to either cancel or quickly switch to the online format, this time people had more time to prepare.

Also, in 2020 I barely participated in any conference. I just didn't feel like spending more time online after the whole day of working remotely. Working remotely during the lock-down is nothing like working remotely before the pandemic. In incomparably worse. The fact that you are stuck at home makes you hate this style of work. So if your only experience with working from home is during the pandemic - trust me, normally it's not that bad.

At the end of 2020 I took a break from taking new clients, spent some time reading books and blogging, recorded a course for Talk Python Training and life was all good again. So in 2021 I decided to participate in a few conferences and ended up speaking at around 10 of them. From big, international ones, to small, local, one-afternoon ones. Each of them had a different approach and used different tools, so I've decided to summarize my experience. I hope this blog post will be useful for any future conference organizers.

One room per talk, one room per track, or...?

How many chat rooms do you need for your conferences? Are you going to put 800 people into one chat room? Or are you going to make a separate room for each of those 100+ talks that you have? The number of chat rooms depends on the size of you conference. For a small one (up to 30 talks) having a separate room for each talk and them a few general rooms worked very well. When I got a room for my talk, I felt the sense of ownership and I was trying really hard to answer all the questions and keep the conversations going there. Not that I don't answer questions if I'm not given my own, precious chat room, but here no questions were lost or mixed with other questions as people were explicitly asking things related to my topic.

But that probably wouldn't work for a large conference. I think one of the big international ones tried to have one room per talk last year (and they had over 100 talks).

Zoom, discord, matrix, or...?
Discord - good
Hopin - used by Pycon India. Very nice and clean interface, contains tools for networking, video streams.
Tool that pycon australia used - also very nice, you could play videos minimized while chatting with people.


Guidance for speakers
Having a one document with all the information for the speaker is awesome. You can edit this document as something changes. If you use only emails and something changes, you need to send another email. And then I end up frantically looking through my emails to figure out where I'm supposed to find my speaker link 10 minutes before my talk (not fun). So kudos to that one conference that put an amazing google doc with all the important information for the speakers.

Live talks or prerecorded ones
I'm a huge fan of pre-recorded talks. Unfortunately, conference organizers usually don't share my enthusiasm. I can't blame them. You want talks at your conference to be unique. If someone has a video with their talk, it's very tempting to send the same video to every conference. And that would be boring. So it's better to have live talks even tough that includes technical problems and then some talks have to be rescheduled, start late or have microphone/internet issues.

But hear me out - a prerecorded talk means that speaker has more room to put something more interesting into their talk. Like live coding. It's great to see some tool or library in practice through a live demo. And some speakers do them, but I don't - there are too many things that can go wrong that it's just not worth it. But if your talk is prerecorded, then it's a different story. You have unlimited tries at the live demo. For most conferences this year I had the same talk where I presented 3 tools to manage Python version and dependencies (you can see the video TODO: here). And I would love to show them by running commands in my terminal, but some commands take time (installing new Python version) and for other I'm just afraid of making some stupid mistakes that would compromise the demo - especially since my talks are always too long and I always have to relentlessly cut out content to fit into the time limit. So I sticked with slides.

Prerecorded talks are great not only for live demos. With relatively small effort in the postprocessing process you can make them really nice. When you mention some library, you don't have to juggle you windows to show the github page of that library - you can put a floating window with that github page and a link right next to the code that you are showing and viewers don't have to context-switch. Zooming in on some specific code blocks that you are currently explaining is another simple, yet efficient way to breaking the boredom of staring on a page of code for 2 minutes.

In the end, I only had a chance to prerecord 2 short talks this year (a 5-minute long and 10-minute long versions of the same talk). I was very happy with the results - the pace was great and the flow of information was much more coherent than if I would do this talk live. The first time I was recording my 5-minute-long lightning talk, I had to shot it probably 10 times to fit into the strict limit of 5 minutes. But the best thing about recording a lightning talk 10 times is that you spend 1 hour in total and you are done.

So if your conference consists of very short talks, consider accepting prerecorded talks. If the speaker has technical problem and their talk is 30 minutes long, wasting 5 minutes is probably fine (but very stressful). Wasting 5 minutes when the whole talk is 5 or 10 minutes long - I would not want to be that speaker. But even for standard 30 or 45 minutes long talks, maybe accepting prerecorded videos could be a nice way to make your conference stand out? And if you decided to do that, don't just "allow" people to submit a prerecorded talk as a backup. If I know that it's a backup and probably won't be used, I have no reason to put any extra effort in making that video nicely polished and edited. So if you want to have nice prerecorded videos, don't just *allow* it, but **encourage** your speakers to submit them.

All in all, my experience with online talks was mostly positive. I can't really compare 2020's conferences to 2021's ones because in 2020 I didn't participate in many. But from what I've heard when talking with other speakers, organization of conferences has improved a lot. Each new conference that happens online builds on top of the experience from the previous one. And that's great. And the best parts of conference being online? I spoke at conferences and meet amazing people at 4 continents paying exactly $0 for travel and not having to take a single day of holidays!
