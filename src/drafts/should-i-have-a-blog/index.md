Yes.

Did you really expect a different answer? You came to a *blog* to read *an article* on whether you should have a blog or not. Did you really think that for once the answer would be "no, you shouldn't. Well, thinking about it more, I'm closing my blog too. Say≈çnara!"

Blogs are great. They have many benefits. But they take a lot of time if you want to write regularly. And they are not the only way of producing great content.

There was a [discussion about blogging](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32137336) on Hacker News some time ago and most comments were "yes, it's a good idea." Ok, I know, those were not very objective arguments. Top comments were from people who had blogs for years. They shared many benefits like getting better at writing, landing new jobs or meeting like-minded people. And they could describe all those benefits with beautiful, well versed words because **they got better at writing thanks to blogging**. I wasn't expecting a top comment to say "No, I don't have a blog and my life is much better thanks to that." On the other hand, a comment from someone who doesn't have a blog is also not objective. How do they know how their life would change if they had one?

Here is my take.

Yes. If you **can** and you **want** to - start a blog.

## You will get better at writing

When I was [migrating from my old blog stack to a new one ]({% postUrl "new-blog-who-dis" %}), I had to go through all my blog posts and fix shortcodes and other small details. And looking at blog posts from 2019 made me cringe when I saw so many obvious errors. Probably when I look back at this post in 2027 when moving to a yet another blogging setup, I will also be embarrassed.

I definitely got better at writing from the simple practice. I've read books on how to write better, like the classic *[The Elements of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style)* but not much knowledge stuck with me. Definitely not enough that during the act of writing I would remember that "ahh, here I should change this form as the book recommends on page 87". No, just like with anything else in life, you will get better by the simple act of regular practice. And this will have positive impact on your work, especially if you work remotely and majority of your communication is in writing.

## You will learn that you are wrong

You will learn that are you wrong. From strangers on the internet. Commenting on your articles. Seriously, try writing something incorrect on reddit or Hacker News and someone will almost certainly point out the shortcomings of your article.

{% postImage "cunninghams-law.jpg", "Screenshot from Quora about Cunningham's law", "", "For some reason people <em>really</em> don't want to let others be wrong on the internet" %}

This can be discouraging. There is nothing worse than getting a negative feedback on something that you spent a lot of time researching, editing 10 times, etc. 

Some people might simply misunderstood you. And some are trolls, downvoting you articles or posting stupid comments. There is not much you can do about this. Some people deal with that by not reading comments. I initially decided to not include a comments section on my blog for that reason - I prefer to spend my time writing useful articles instead of arguing with strangers on the internet. But then I added comments and it wasn't too bad. Most of the time I got valuable feedback or nice words of encouragement. I still got a few comments that didn't make any sense, but there were much less of those than I expected (and they didn't pass the moderation that I had in place back then).

When moving my blog to a new platform, I've decided to switch to [giscus](https://giscus.app/) that stores comments on GitHub. It requires readers to log in before they can post a comment, which might be a bit inconvenient, but it's a good way to filter out vast majority of trolls. I also have a [contact form](/about/#contact-me) where people can contact me if they don't want to post a comment publicly and I sometimes receive an email from a reader.

## You *might* get some leads

My blog was never the best source of job leads. Initially I tried much harder to position myself here as a Python consultant. I had more links shouting "hey, hire me!" here and there (including a small, sticky ad on the side of each blog post that was always in the view). I ran with this setup for over a year and during that time I was contacted by one client.

Then my network of connections on LinkedIn grew, I specialized in a niche Python commercial framework and I realized that I don't necessary need to look for job through my blog. So with a big relief, I could limit the amount of advertisement.

Even though for me using the blog for finding clients didn't work, I don't think I was doing it right. I wasn't aggressive enough. I didn't offer free e-books to people signing up for my newsletter. Or adding their emails to a sales funnel and spamming them with webinars about all the cool things I could do for them. But the thing is - I didn't want to be aggressive. I wanted to write about Python and I knew that my blog will be read by other programmers who don't care if I can help them build a document management tool, risk management platform, or be their next team leader (but if you do - [hey, hire me!](/consulting)).

Your audience will probably be other programmers, not people hiring programmer. So don't expect to have someone offer you a job because of a fantastic article on type hints that you wrote. Yes, it can happen, but don't count of being flooded with job offers. You would need a completely different type of a blog than mine to target managers.

If you really want your blog to be the source of work or an additional income for you, I think you have two choices:

- **Have a niche**. If you write about a niche topic and you establish expertise through your articles, you might get contacted by clients looking for experts in your field. Of course, as long as you don't drown in a sea of paid advertisement and those clients can actually find your blog. %% "drown in a sea of ..." - nie wiedzialem jak lepiej napisac ze "nie utoniesz w morzu platnych ogloszen" %%
- Go all in into **advertisement** and focus on making your blog a source of income. Analyze your traffic, target advertisement towards your readers, consistently post on social networks, grow your network as much as possible. Maybe even fill your blog with ads. You will probably lose a lot of initial readers who discovered your blog because of your unique ideas. But with plenty of marketing, it starts to be more of a numbers game. For every genuinely interested reader you lose, you gain five others that subscribe mostly because you get in front of them in so many other places.

I don't treat my blog as work or a source of income. I'm cross-posting my articles on Medium and that was bringing a few bucks every month as part of their Partner Program. I'm writing *was* because in August Medium slashed the payoffs for most of the writers on their platform and now I'm down from around $40/month to less than $10 per month. But I was always treating Medium as a way of reaching more readers (unlike all the poor folks who were making a living from writing on Medium and now need to find a new job).

In terms of maximizing my financial gains - I completely messed up that one. I've joined their Partner Program after my articles about CLI tools and Mac apps gained hundreds of thousands of reads on Medium and I've probably left a few thousands $ on the table by not getting paid for those reads.

{% postImage "late-to-medium-party.jpg", "Screenshot from my earnings in Medium", "", "One of my most popular articles on Medium that brought me thousands of reads and $0 in the early days" %}

But I'm sure people who found a different ways to monetize their blogs can give you a different advice. And money is not always the [best thing your blog can do for you](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35164819).

## Writing takes time

Writing the first draft of your article is only part of work. You need to at least edit and proofread it. And if you're a perfectionist like me, you could easily spend days rewriting and polishing a single article. If you want to reach more readers, you also need to prepare social media posts, make some social images, write a newsletter, etc.

I usually write in bursts, mostly between contracts. I launched my blog in 2019 when I started freelancing. But a bulk of my articles were written either when I took a half-a-year off to work on my Python course, or during a one-month long break last year. When working full-time I don't have much time for blogging. I often start some drafts when I'm struck by an idea, but I have little time to edit and publish them. Some of the drafts take literally years to write. I just keep adding random ideas and new paragraphs until I have enough content to sit down and turn that into an article.

I have a family that I ~~need to~~ want to [*edited by his wife*] spend time with after work. So after 8 hours of work, I don't have time to sit down and write articles. Sometimes I might have a free evening or weekend that I can spend with the computer, but I also have other responsibilities. I have a side-project that requires a small amount of support, I need to do accounting for my company, etc. Blogging doesn't bring money, so it has a lower priority.

Now I'm trying to get some time back by having someone proofread and edit my articles for clarity. And indeed, I save time by not having to rerun my articles through Grammarly, but I also spend time discussing unclear sentences. Still, in the long run it's a great idea to have someone read your articles (be it a friend or a professional who does that for money). You will be surprised how many sentences that sound perfectly clear in my head are completely confusing to someone else!

## Your audience *might* grow. Eventually

If you decide to start a blog, don't be discouraged that initially only few people will read it. Actually, be prepared that for a very long time your audience will be small. Is it ok for you? Or does blogging only makes sense for you can get in front of thousands of people on day one?

If you want to reach more audience, try blogging on some of the existing platform like Medium or Substack. It's much easier to reach wider audience there, than on your own website under you own domain.

However, the main problem with those blogging platforms is that **you give up all the control over your content and your audience**. Let's say you've built a large audience on Medium and one day you wake up to see that your account was banned and all your articles were deleted. All the hard work you did for years is gone. And all those readers whom you looked after so carefully %%"o ktorych tak pieczolowicie dbales" - nie wiem jak to lepiej napisac %%and always answered all their comments can no longer be reached. Sounds painful? That's why I prefer to have my own blog. Even though on Medium (where I only post articles when I remember to do so) I have 3x more "followers" than I have subscribers in my newsletter. But for me Medium is just an addition to my blog.

In case you're wondering how many people read a blog like mine - here's how my audience grew in the first three years of my blog:

{% postImage "daily-readers-at-the-beginning.jpg", "Growth of my audience at the beginning" %}

I was lucky that some articles got hundreds of views from Hacker News or reddit at the very beginning of my blog. And even with that, on an average day I had less than 10 visitors. Maybe a few more, because those statistics don't include people with ad blockers that block the Google Analytics tracking code.

And that's how the statistics look since I replaced Google Analytics with [umami.js](https://umami.is/):

{% postImage "readers-now.jpg", "Statistics for the last 11 months of my blog" %}

Now I get on average 8000 page views per month. If I don't write regularly, that number goes down (see the March-June period when I was making conference talks and didn't publish anything). If I publish new pieces and have time to get them front of more people through my social networks, that number goes up (see July when I published new articles). The total number of readers might be a bit higher, since I try to respect people's privacy and don't track visitors with `Do Not Track` setting enabled.

My main takeaway here is that the number of views and readers [should not be the main motivation for writing](https://every.to/divinations/how-to-write-essays-that-spread). It's a very fleeting motivation.

## What about YouTube or podcasts?

I don't know. I don't have a YouTube channel or a podcast. I love podcasts and since a few years I listen more than I read. I've been a guest on a couple of episodes and it was fun. If I had someone that I enjoy talking with I wouldn't mind hosting a podcast, but I can't think of a subject I could talk about for hundreds of episodes. There are already a couple of Python-related podcasts, so this niche feels saturated. On the other hand, the niche for "beginner-friendly tech podcasts" feels even more saturated, yet some time ago I listened to the [ladybug podcast](https://www.ladybug.dev/) and I was surprised how many interesting topic they were constantly coming up with.

## Conclusions

You can look at blogging as on any other side project - it will make you better at specific things. Just like building React apps makes you a better React developer, writing makes you a better writer. You can treat it as a way to practice a particular skillset and think "I need to get better at communicating clearly in a written form".

But, as with most side projects, it's better if you do this because you're genuinely interested in blogging and you want to write (even if no one will read it).
