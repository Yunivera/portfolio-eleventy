title: What's up with the blog?
---

I haven't written any new blog post for almost a year. I know that some of you are eagerly waiting for more articles from the "Writing Faster Python" series. And I promise I will continue this series, don't worry!

I've started a bigger project for a new client early this year. This, plus some family obligations took (and are still taking) most of my time. At the same time, I've "accidentally" started a side project (completely unrelated with Python actually!) and opened a new company. With all that, I barely had any time left that I spent on making one talk and presenting it at a bunch of conferences around the world (oh the convenience of online conferences!)

## The side project

It's a Python blog, so if you are here for Python stuff, you won't find any in this section. But if you an avid reader of IndieHackers and you've always dreamed about having some passive income from a side project that generates money when you sleep - keep reading. Ok, maybe mine doesn't generate money when I sleep. Well, it does, but I had to put more time than it was worth it.

I will probably write an article or two.

## What's next?

I want to get back to blogging. I miss that. But I also want to start writing about other things than Python. Maybe I will write an article or two about my experience building a side-project that targets clients (unlike doing business-to-business) and why I never want to do this again. We will see.
