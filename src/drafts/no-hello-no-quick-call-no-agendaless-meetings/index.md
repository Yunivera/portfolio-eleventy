Hi,

You probably received a link to this website because you did one of the common mistakes of working remotely:

- You started a conversation by writing "hi", or  "hello" or even maybe "Good morning Sebastian, I have a question". And then you waited. And waited. And waited for minutes (or hours, if I was busy and you were patient) without a single word explaining what problem are you facing.
- You asked me for a "quick call" (or maybe just a "call") without explaining what do you want to talk about in a hope that I will drop everything and jump right into helping you.
- You invited me to a meeting without a description or an agenda.

Don't worry, I'm not mad at you. Those are common mistakes that people make when working remotely. Maybe you worked in an environment where the productivity is low, so everyone has time to jump on a quick call or chat with you any time you ask. Or maybe you're a manager and no one had the courage to explain that all those interruptions are bad and how can you make them a bit *less bad*. There is another possibility - you're lazy and selfish, so you don't care how your interruptions are affecting others because your questions needs to be answered right now with minimal effort from your end. But I'm sure that's not the case. We are all kind, hard-working people who care deeply about their team members, and we only sometimes need a little bit of additional guidance.

Let me explain why those three remote mistakes are bad, how you can do things better, and why it's good **for you** if you avoid them in the future.

## No "hello"

This one is so common that there is already a beautiful [nohello.net](https://nohello.net/en/) website explaining why it's better to ask your question directly, instead of starting with "hello" and waiting for a reply before you ask the actual question. I'm not going to repeat what the website says, but the gist is that if you write your question right away, you will get an answer much faster. There is really no need to wait for me to come and "hi" back before you start writing what's the problem. Especially since I might get busy again and the wait time will get longer.

But there is more than that to the "hello" problem, especially if you want to ask for a technical assistance.

Let me show you different ways of asking about the same thing, sorted from the *worst* way to ask a question to the *best* one. Let's say that we added a new argument to a function called `frobnicate` but we forgot to update the usage of this function in all the places in the code. And now one of our colleagues is facing a problem caused by that, so they decide to ask for help:

1. "Hi" (or "Hello" or even "Hi, I have a question"). This is absolutely the worst way to start the conversation when you have a problem. I have no clue what do you want or if it's urgent. And you're waiting until I'm around the keyboard to answer "hi" before you get a chance to explain your issue.
2. "Hi, the `frobnicate` function doesn't work". Ok, at least we have a bit of a context about the topic of our conversation. But I still have no clue what do you mean by "doesn't work". Is it throwing an error or doesn't work as expected? Is it happening on your local computer or did it stopped working in production and the company is loosing millions every minute?
3. "Hi, I tried to run the `frobnicate` function in the staging environment, but it's throwing an `Error: missing argument 'count'`. I'm on the 'feature-123' code branch". Sweet, we're almost there. I know what function you're calling, in what context, and what error you get. But we can still do better.
    1. There is another, very misleading version of this question that can send us both on a path of debugging a wrong problem. Compare the previous version with the following one: "Hi, I tried to run the `frobnicate` function in the staging environment, but it's throwing an error about count argument. I'm on the the 'feature-123' code branch". And now imagine that they simply misspelled the word "count" in their function, which you would immediately spot if you saw the full error. But you didn't see the whole error and instead you wrongly assumed that the issue is with the `frobnicate` function itself. So you both embark on a completely needless adventure of "changing random parts of the code and scratching your heads why nothing makes the error go away". You end up wasting hours because of a typo. That's why I strongly recommend that you include the stack trace in your message (and not only the last error, but the full stack track because often the crucial part is somewhere in the middle). Or at least, paste the exact error message instead of trying to describe with your words what *you think* is not working.
4. "Hi, I tried to run the `frobnicate` function in the staging environment, but it's throwing an `Error: missing argument 'count'`. I'm on the 'feature-123' code branch. I compared this with production environment and there it works. I also pulled the latest code from Mike. Here is the full stack trace: ..." This is the perfect example of asking for help online. It not only gives the exact error message, context in which it happens but also explains what you tried so far, so I can avoid giving you advice like "compare it with the production environment" or "did you pull the latest code", because I know you already tried that. Honestly, this is such a good and concrete ask, that I will probably make additional effort to at least think about the possible solution, even if I'm in the middle of doing something else.

## No "quick call"

This is a very similar problem to the "hello" one, except that you now want to move from the *asynchronous* way of solving the problem to the *synchronous* one. And just like with "hello", asking for a "quick call" has a couple of problems:

- Call is more distracting than a chat message. I can answer a simple message or two in a chat without losing the context of what I'm currently working on. But for calls, I need to focus more attention and thus it takes much longer to recover. You may think you took 30 seconds of my time, but in reality it's always more.
- Sometimes a message is enough. Some calls are basically equivalent to exchanging a few messages on the chat. Congratulations, you just saved yourself 10 seconds of writing down your question.
- Talking (or rather, *writing*) yourself through the problem can help you solve it. [Rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) really works. I've witnessed countless times when after explaining what exactly was the issue, the message was deleted or it was followed by "never mind", because my interlocutor figured out how to fix it.
- *Calls are ephemeral. Written messages are eternal*. At least until the servers go down or the company hosting your favorite chat app closes. But the best thing about written words is that you can always come back and find this conversation later, reminding yourself how to solve a specific problem, or why you decided to fix it that way[^1].

So when I answer your "quick call?" with "what's the problem?" - that's really for your own good ðŸ˜‰. I want you to think through the problem and have an answer written down for the future, without completely distracting me from my work.

A lot of what I wrote about the "quick call" can also apply to our *last horseman of wasted time in a remote environment*. Although this metaphor doesn't make that much sense if there are only three of them. So please share in the comments what other way of wasting other peoples' time deserves the title of the 4th horseman.

## "No agenda" meetings

Have you ever been invited to a meeting and you had no clue what is it going to be about until you actually joined it? Ahh, yes, the "no agenda" meetings, or how I like to call them - the "surprise meetings". Apparently for some people, wasting time of one other person is not enough, so they invite multiple people "just in case they are needed". And who needs agenda when all the talking points are safely stored in your head?

I try to apply the "no agenda, no attenda" rule (which means that I try to decline meetings that have no agenda) and while it works for me, I don't think others are in such a comfortable situation and have so understanding managers.

Having an agenda or at least a detailed description has so many benefits that literally nothing justifies "agenda-less" meetings:

- If I know the agenda up front, I can prepare for the meeting. If I need to check something or refresh my memory, I can do this in advance without wasting everyone's time. If we will need to make a decision, I can think about possible options and prepare a list of pros and cons if the decision is tough.
- If I can answer all the questions from the agenda with a message - congratulations, we just saved everyone's time by not having a meeting!
- Agenda gives the meeting a purpose and a checklist. Are we there to make a decision? Great, we can wrap up the meeting as soon as we make one. Are we there to understand some topics? Great, let's prepare a checklist to make sure we stay on track and not forget anything. Without the agenda it's hard to see if we already discussed everything that was needed or if we even fulfilled the purpose of the meeting.
- I can see if I'm even needed in that meeting. Sometimes I get invited to a meeting only because I'm leading a project or a team, but the meeting is completely non-technical and requires no input from my side. From time to time, I'm even invited to a meeting that's not even about my project. If I knew upfront what the meeting will be about, I could either skip it or plan my time accordingly. For example, if I know that the meeting will most likely not require much input from my side, but I should still participate in case a technical question is raised, I will simply plan to do some code reviews with the meeting running in the background.

If you invite a technical person like me to a meeting, you most likely want one of three things:

- You want me to explain you something that is completely new to you. If I know up front what's that, I can send you a link to the relevant documentation. And then usually one of two things happen. You either find all your answers in the documentation, so the meeting is no longer needed, or you read/skim the documentation and have at least a basic understanding of what we will talk about, so the eventual meeting will be much more productive.
- You want to ask specific technical question(s). Then it's better to ask it in a written form, because I can think about my answer and do the necessary research in my own pace. I won't be wasting your (and possibly other people's) time during the meeting searching for the answer or give you a wrong one, because you rushed me and I didn't have time to carefully consider all the factors.
- You want to ask me about something I did in the past. Just like with the previous point, I need a bit of time to refresh my memory and prepare. Look, technology is a very fast-moving environment. That feature I built two months ago? I probably built 3 other things in the meantime and I completely forgot how the thing you want to ask me about works. Spending 10 minutes alone preparing for the meeting will be much more fruitful than spending 30 minutes **during** the meeting franticly jumping through the code, trying to remember what each function did and either answering your questions in the meantime or feeling the weight of silence when you look at my screen and all the mistakes I make when typing. Not to mention that we would be wasting 30 minutes of time for multiple people.

## ~~Content~~ Context is king

When working remotely, asking for help is often just a few keystrokes away. So it's tempting to "quickly" ask someone for help when you get stuck. But unlike when you're in an office, you can't easily see if that other person is busy and whether or not you will interrupt them (unless they remember to set the "don't disturb" status in the messaging app).

But to get the best help, you also need to give something back. Describe the problem you're facing with as many details as possible. Try to explain your problem in a written form before you jump on a call. When planning a meeting, let everyone prepare by outlining a clear agenda for the meeting. Trust me, this will make all your online interactions more efficient and you will solve your problems much faster. It will also make your peers *want to help* you instead of taking a deep breath and closing the chat window each time they get a "hi" or "quick call?" message from you.

[^1]: Of course, if your chat application has a working "search" feature. Yes, I'm looking at you Microsoft Teams and your atrocious search functionality that for years could not find a simple message in my chats.
