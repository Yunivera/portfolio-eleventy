title: Is this blog dead?

TODO: Duplicate of "what's next?"

Not counting the last article (TODO: remove this line if this is the first post), last blog post was written over 1,5 year ago. Is this blog dead?

Hopefully not. I've been busy. I've opened a company, started a side project (that's currently generating ~300$ monthly recurring revenue with crazy high churn rate and a very little support from my side, but the revenue is surprisingly still growing) and - the biggest time sink - got new family obligations. All that while working full time as a lead developer on a quite challenging project. So unfortunately, there was no time left for blogging.

But I want to change that. And not only I want get back to blogging, but also change the formula. Instead of writing only about Python, I want to write about everything that interests me. Python, productivity, side projects (or rather, "business", as we - entrepreneurs - call it).


First things first - I need to redesign my blog. I always wanted to have a dark theme, plus I'm tired of the current look. And it's an unwritten rule that when you go back to your personal website after a break, you HAVE rewrite it. So expect some slight redesign in the future as I will move from Jekyll to Eleventy (oh, static sites are also something that I want to write about - I'm a huge fan).

Stay tuned!
